A simple map example with clustering and popups using [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) + [MarkerCluster](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet.markercluster).

It currently uses a [Wikimedia Maps](https://maps.wikimedia.org) Tile Server as a placeholder. Replace this with a paid service:
- Add an access token from [Mapbox](http://www.mapbox.com)
- Change the attribution
- Change the tile layer

Furthermore, it makes use of [unpkg](https://unpkg.com). Concatenate and minify these files according to your own workflow.
